Approval:

A successful call to the "approve" function triggers an "Approval" event.

The "approve" method authorizes given address to spend tokens
from the address of the account that issued the "approve" method up to the specified amount.


Difference between transfer to a transferFrom function:

The "transferFrom" in combination with "approve" method is for delegating spending rights and using said rights.
The "approve" method is being used to delegate spending rights up to certain specified amount,
and "transferFrom" method is used by the spender to transfer tokens from the owner's account to a recipient.

Unlike The "transferFrom" method, the "transfer" method is used to send tokens directly from the address of the account that issued the transfer,
to the given address up to the given amount, there is no delegation of rights and the transfer is being issued directly by the owner.

Majority of the token transactions happen with the transfer "method".
